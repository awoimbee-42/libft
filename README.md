# Libft
My own libC to use at 42.
Currently, all the functions are defined in libft.h
## What's inside
My libft contains lots of functions and datatypes with their own 'operators', all of them are described in libft.h and again by the folder names in ./src
### At the time of writing, this libft contains :
#### libmem
ft_bzero
ft_mem(...) Functions in here are generaly optimized to use the biggest registers available and use as few cpu cycles as possible
#### libstr
ft_str(...)
#### libnb
ft_(...)atoi(...)
ft_itoa
ft_swap(...)
#### libchar
ft_is(...)
#### libfd
ft_put(...)
get_next_line
#### ft_printf
ft_printf
ft_sprintf
ft_vprintf
(...)
#### t_lst
The t_lst datatype and it's operators
#### t_queue
The t_queue datatype and it's operators.
t_queue is a 'rotary' queue based on an array, it's *really* fast
#### t_vec4
An implementation for vectors of 4 floats (x, y, z, w) using SSE2
#### other
